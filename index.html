               Coffee preparation is a process of turning coffee into a beverage.While the particular steps 
               vary with type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps:Raw coffee 
               beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>,the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>,
               the ground coffee beans must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (<a href="brewing.html">brewed</a>),
               and finally the liquid coffee must then be separated from the used grounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coffee is brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas coffee must be purchased or unprocessed 
                or already roasted or already roasted and ground.Coffee is often vaccum packed to prevent
                oxidation and lengthen it's shell life
